                    <h2>Educational History</h2>
                        <p>My name is David Lopez and I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY.  Most of my school life was done in public school.  Public Schools in Brooklyn can be an adventure.</p>
                        <p>For middle school, or Junior High School in my day, I went to Junior High School 50.  The school did not have the greatest reputation but my class managed to make it one of the greatest school experiences.</p>
                        <p>Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers was home for my highschool years.  I breezed through high school and had only 3 classes my last year.  With so much time, I became a social bug, going to parties, meeting new people, and learning how to network for business purposes.</p>
